There are two kinds of traversal techniques.
1) Breath first search
2) Depth first search


BREATH FIRST SEARCH :-
For this technique, we are going to create two list.
que = []
result = []
the que list is going to store the node. for example there is a parent node 42 and 21 and 52 as its child node.
first we are going to store the node in the que list and the value of that node is stored in result node.
Then the node will be checked if it has the child nodes. If it has child node (i.e. 21 and 52) then those nodes will be
stored in the que list and the root node will be popped of. Further, the value of those nodes will be stored in the
result list. at last, it is seen that these nodes have further child nodes or node. If not, these nodes will be popped
of from the que list

DEPTH FIRST SEARCH :-
We can Use the methods to achieve this technique.
a) Pre-order :- This is the method in which the "node.left.value" is given the priority and when there is no more nodes on the
left, then the sibling node for this is printed . This is the 1st method.
b) Post-order :- In this method, we are going to just look for the left or right node first instead of writing it to the
result List. if it does not contain any more left or right node, then we are going to write it to the result list.
c) Inorder :- In this method, we first gi left, write the value in the result list and then go right.

The code lines used for these methods are the same. The only difference is present in the positioning of those lines.
